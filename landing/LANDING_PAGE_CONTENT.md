## Introduction Section
### What is Proof of Creation?

Proof of Creation (PoC) is a revolutionary authenticity solution designed to protect your creative works in the era of generative AI. By embedding tamper-proof metadata into images and recording provenance information from the moment of creation using cryptographic technology, PoC provides irrefutable evidence for legal and commercial disputes.

**Key Features:**
- 🛡️ **Tamper-proof Protection**: Immutable metadata embedded directly into your creations
- 📝 **Complete Provenance Chain**: Track creation, editing, and distribution history
- ⚖️ **Legal Evidence**: Provide indisputable proof in legal and commercial disputes
- 🔗 **Blockchain Security**: Dual-layer protection with on-chain certificates

## Standards & Compliance Section
### Following Global Standards

#### C2PA Compliance
Proof of Creation adheres to the **C2PA (Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity)** standard - the same trusted framework adopted by industry leaders:

- **Adobe** - Integrated in Photoshop and Creative Suite
- **Google** - "About this image" feature implementation
- **Microsoft** - Content authenticity initiatives
- **Amazon** - Digital content verification

This unprecedented adoption rate in the creative industry ensures your content remains verifiable across all major platforms.

#### Security Features
- **X.509 Digital Signatures**: Even a single byte modification invalidates verification
- **Cumulative Authentication Chain**: Each step (creation, editing, redistribution) adds a signed record
- **Traceable Authenticity**: Complete history from origin to current state
